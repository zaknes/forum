# Forum v3

I definitely have come a far way with Laravel. This was my first ever Laravel project when I was just learning the framework. Since then I have learned a lot.

This *new version* will be a nice refresh that will include everything that I have learned over the months.

This will be a test-driven project. An approach that I learned greatly from Adam Wathan's [Test Driven Laravel](https://testdrivenlaravel.com) course.
